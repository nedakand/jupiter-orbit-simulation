# Gravity Assist Simulation (VPython)

This project simulates a spacecraft performing a gravity assist maneuver around Jupiter
using numerical integration of Newtonian gravity.

## Overview
- Models the spacecraft and Jupiter as interacting bodies
- Updates momentum and position using fixed time steps
- Visualizes the spacecraft trajectory and velocity over time
- Stops the simulation if the spacecraft crashes or escapes

## Concepts
- Numerical integration of equations of motion
- Vector-based force calculations
- Simulation stability and termination conditions
- Data visualization
